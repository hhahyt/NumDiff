# Brief description

NumDiff provides a modern Fortran interface for computing the Jacobian (derivative) matrix of `m` nonlinear functions which depend on `n` variables. The Jacobian matrix is required for various applications, including numerical optimization. The library also provides for computing the sparsity of this matrix, and returning the Jacobian in sparse or dense form.
