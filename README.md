# Brief description

NumDiff provides a modern Fortran interface for computing the Jacobian (derivative) matrix of `m` nonlinear functions which depend on `n` variables. The Jacobian matrix is required for various applications, including numerical optimization. The library also provides for computing the sparsity of this matrix, and returning the Jacobian in sparse or dense form.

# Status

This is currently an experimental work in progress and is not production ready. The goal is a comprehensive library that contains a full suite of computationally efficient implementations of algorithms for sparsity determination and numerical differentiation.
